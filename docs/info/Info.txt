Peer feedback

We will use peer feedback system. Every student has to (individually) give feedback to two other projects. Please be constructive, and remember that peer feedback is as much important for the peer as well as the recepient. 

Supervision

I will reserve 20 minutes per group for supervision during weeks 2+3, which we will arrange on an indivual basis. 

You are still welcome to write emails and drop by the office. 

Formalities

Please include a front page with full names, student IDs, course name/number, date and project name on both projects. The front page does not count towards the total page number.
